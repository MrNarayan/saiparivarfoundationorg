 Hello Administrator, 
 
 You got a new message from SaiParivarFoundation! 
 

 From: Preethi Thutika

 Month:  
 Message: Namaskaram,

My name is Preethi Thutika. I am currerntly visiting the Bellevue area and plan to stay here for the forceable future. I am originally from the bay area where I had been an active volunteer for almost 3-4 years at the Shirdi Sai Darbar in Sunnyvale, CA (https://shirdisaidarbar.org/).

I am also part of the global Sai Parayanam group and enjoy staying connected with the Sai community. I would love to volunteer my time here at the Bellevue Sai Temple and relish in Baba's energy and space. 

I hope to hear back from you on how I could be of service to Baba's temple & the community.

Thank you & Best Regards
Preethi
