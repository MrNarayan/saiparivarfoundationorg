 Hello Administrator, 
 
 You got a new message from SaiParivarFoundation!

 Month: November 
 Message: Good day!

I would like to make a small food donation to the temple, will there be a food and clothing drive on the 11th of this month? Are there any specific food items that I should bring? What time is best to stop by? I certainly don't want to intrude or interrupt. Thank you!

Peace and blessings,
