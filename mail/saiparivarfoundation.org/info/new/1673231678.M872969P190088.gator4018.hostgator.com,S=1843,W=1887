 Hello Administrator, 
 
 You got a new message from SaiParivarFoundation!

 Message: Dear Sai Parivar Foundation, 
I hope you are having a wonderful week.  
 
I’m Olivia, a high school student and the host of Let’s Talk Polarization podcast. LTP hosts speakers from around the globe to discuss contentious political issues—from religion to social media to gun control—to encourage respectful discourse and national unity. We have reached 10+ speakers and 1,500+ listeners.
 
This month, we are arranging a conversation between religious individuals (Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, etc), regarding religion, political ideology, and governance.
 
It is my pleasure to extend an invitation to you.
 
I thank you for your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.
 
Sincerely,
Olivia Chiang
