 Message: Greetings,

We are asking for signatures for our online petition to urge companies to stop manufacturing in China. We believe that the Chinese Communist Party has and is committing human rights violations and is a threat to freedom around the world.

We our hoping to spread awareness and use our petition to convince companies to manufacture in countries other than China.

Your support is greatly appreciated!

Please sign the petition here:

Best Regards,
