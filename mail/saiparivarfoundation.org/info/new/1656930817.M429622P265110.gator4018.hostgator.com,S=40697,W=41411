Unite The Force is wishing you and yours a very happy fourth of July and a
day full of fun as you celebrate our nation's birthday. Happy Independence
Day!


=F0=9F=91=8B=F0=9F=8F=BB=F0=9F=A4=A0: You've received this because I'm vigo=
rously seeking to, at least,
temporarily rent. Am currently receiving $840 per month from SSA for
Disability. $170 of that goes to storage bill. Am proposing a starting rate
of $200 =E2=80=93 $400. Can only offer an affordable range because: i
won't be able to afford other expenses. A couple examples of other
expenses are: bus fare and personal supplies.
Some things I'm saving up for are: network cards and a mode of
transportation.



:: Categories of Prospects + Context ::
Note: The pursuit for a base is operations has resulted in the research and
development of: email lists with the help of Google Maps and Facebook.
Links to lists made in Google Maps are included below.


=E2=80=A2 Non Profits, Housing Authorities and Social Services: <
https://maps.app.goo.gl/ri6t3cnEc1oGpbQM8>

* N.P., H.A., S.S. - Requesting assistance with: funds to help pay for
motel, hotel, inn or lodge; finding an affordable place and rent. Am also
open to: a professional partnership; or intern/ apprenticeship.


=E2=80=A2 Places of Worship - (P.o.W.): Churches, Synagogues, Mosques, Temp=
les and
Cathedrals:
<https://maps.app.goo.gl/PbTMuRfdu18w12sH9>

* Am asking religious leaders to consider helping us by either: issuing a
motel voucher; permission to occasionally use the amenities of a facility;
partnering with; apprenticeship/ internship; or, if you're willing to, rent
directly or forward this proposal to a relevant referral.


=E2=80=A2 Washington Parks & Recreation + National Park Association; Tribal
Nations/ Reservations:

*W.P. & R. + N.P.A. - Asking for Washington Parks & Recreation + National
Parks Association to consider: partnering with or sponsor Unite The Force;
and requesting for permission to occupy any park at any time.

Want to systematically travel and pick up trash along the way whilst
working remotely on other projects. Explicit permission to stay over night
or camp at any park will make it a lot easier to do this and live well.


=E2=80=A2 Farmers & Ranchers:<https://maps.app.goo.gl/V6QHsjoVvYhLS3FEA>

* Am asking that any Farmer or Rancher consider helping us by either:
renting directly/ forward this proposal to anyone of relevance;


=E2=80=A2 Traditional Lodging: Hotels, Motels, Inns and Lodges:<
https://maps.app.goo.gl/m5EmG118CPSUtrmt7>

* Am requesting consideration for discount or sponsorship be applied to
temporary month to month contract. Would be of immense help.


=E2=80=A2 Friends & Family:

* Used to think friend or family would make first move if they could and
want to help. Obviously, that's not the case. Realize that I have to ask.
Reply when you can if you're: family or friend have received this proposal
and are willing to assist or have constructive feedback.



:: Abstract - Why I'm Asking for Help ::
Note: The following is intended to expedite screening process.

Trying to make adjustments so I can complete a variety of projects. The
overall goal is to eventually relaunch and take flight. Current conditions
puts us at risk of not succeeding. Success requires persistence. To be
persistent will require that I get us into a better situation so we can
make the most of each day.

I intend to seek sponsorship, endorsement or partnership contracts after
relaunching. Renting is of the first steps and will be temporary due to
fact that I'm only asking for such an arrangement so "Brink" and I can
eventually live and work out of vehicle.


Top priorities are:

1 =E2=80=A2 Completely Organize Evernote: Organization is one of the main k=
eys to
success. Realized this concept at least 3 years ago. That's what initiated
the compilation of unorganized notes to self. Had been jotting down various
"notes to self" in Google Keep, on paper and on the brain until i finally
discovered and installed Evernote on 01/06/18. Didn't have an official
system when i started writing notes to self on other platforms. Have been
developing a system since this project started. That system is detailed in
the following link: <

>;


4 =E2=80=A2 Build and Launch Employment Program:

Obviously employment program hasn't launched yet. Which prompts me to
elaborate. Recently resumed the development of Unite The Force. Will admit,
with mixed emotion, that refining <=F0=9F=8E=BC Framework for: 'Universal B=
asic
Service'

> took longer than I wanted.

Have re-submitted the proposal through Google's proposition portal on the
evening of 09/07/21 and messaged first ring employees of Google through
LinkedIn about the proposition on the same morning.

06/11/22 ~ emailed Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, for the second time. First
emailed just Sundar on 04/06/22. Message to: Sundar Pichai & Jason Capital

replied directly to me by now. I'm entirely uncertain as to wether or not
anyone at Google is doing anything to get this going without me being
directly involved. No confirmation one way or another has been received to
date. Thus, i have to push harder. Would rather be directly/ remotely
involved with the development. However, I've detailed the solution so
clearly that i shouldn't have to be;

:: Brief Overview of "Machete's" Extended History ::


Born into a broken and impoverished family. Moved a lot before 13. Not the
best, nor the worst, upbringing. Left a formerly neglectful and
psychologically abusive parent at 13. Have been an orphan, 'on my own' and
living out of a backpack ever since. Was 12 when Father, MTC Petty Officer
Ross Wayne Brethour, was murdered on the morning of 02/23/03 <
https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Former-Midland-man-killed-in-carjac=
king-7190866.php
>.

Now I'm 31 and 'technically' still below the poverty line. Say
'technically' because I base net worth on credible potential and network -
not digits in bank account.

Have some farmhand and stagehand experience. For a more detailed overview
of my professional history refer to job history section in Facebook or
by visiting LinkedIn at: <https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/brethoura>.



:: Overview of Recent History ::


Majority of past year has been offline because of living conditions. Was
dealt an unjust eviction over a year ago. Eviction date was 07/01/20.
Wasn't able to negotiate an alternative situation due to lack of funding.
Was receiving $197 on ABD (aged, blind or disabled) through DSHS while
waiting for SSA make a decision on my SSDI claim. Had just enough to rent
storage. For about 10 years whilst not on ABD I had only a food budget
through EBT and $0 cash funds. From about 13 to 20 i didn't even have EBT
or any cash.

Fortunately I secured ABD in time to rent storage after eviction from
sister. Rent was about $90 at first. After eviction it spiked to $159. Had
about $30 per month to work with for the past year. So thankful that
Disability finally came through in June of 2021. Can finally afford to make
some adjustments.

Stayed at Bremerton Salvation Army for a couple of weeks in July of 2020.

Took to the streets shortly after because I was trying to pioneer a
sanitation service. Had noticed Bremerton completely lacks a street team
that collects trash regularly. Street sweepers are useless versus the areas
that litter is a problem. Started the research and development on my own
dime to prove a point. Waste Management: Litter Patrol Proposition
<https://www.evernote.com/shard/s730/sh/085e2adf-e475-4e41-a2b5-63bb0cfb727=
8/319b08f9a098d7e117538223f669bdef>
.

Was dealt another unjust eviction from Simple Safe Storage. Wound up
relocating to Eastside Storage on 11/11/20.

Inadvertently had to postpone and rethink the trash project. Will resume
that when I can. Figured i should also take this issue to Olympia and DC
instead of just Bremerton City Council. The issue can be found all over our
nation and should be dealt with accordingly. Of course, that's only one
part to the trash issue.

:: Recent History Continued ::

Anyways, we've been outside and surviving together in an urban environment
from 09/__/20 to date. For awhile he refused to accompany me back to
Salvation Army. Gave up on trying to convince when he was finally willing
which was towards the end of Fall.

Decided to stay out and 'rough it' through Winter to test our
compatibility. We've spent the past year and nine months outside in a
handful of places for extended periods of time with no plumbing, power or
internet.

Ultimately, I chose to delay the development of personal and professional
goals. Had been more focused on nurturing our relationship. We're still
together and Summer of '22 is here. Am no longer capable of neglecting
myself & Unite The Force.

On 31st birthday =E2=80=93 August 11, 2021 =E2=80=93 Brink and I relocated =
to Lulu D.
Haddon Park from a spot we had been at for 3+ months that's located behind
Kitsap Credit Union and next to Walmart off HW - 303.

Finally =E2=80=93 we had access to: on site plumbing, power and internet af=
ter
extensive time without access to on site amenities. Staked out there even
though we're 'not supposed to'.

Started writing this while there. This essay has received many edits since.
Was given 72 hr. notice to vacate on the morning of 09/15/21. Have left
that place and are staked out somewhere else.

Former spot was: hidden in plain sight; relatively close to an outlet at a
park that's open 24/7; and has access to Xfinity Wifi signal that has been
increasingly cooperative. Been here over a month and have been able to:
edit this essay; build email lists to disseminate essay to; research other;
maintain correspondence with peers; and nurture relations with local
wildlife. =F0=9F=A6=9D =F0=9F=90=BF=EF=B8=8F =F0=9F=90=80

01/11/22 ~ Returned to Walmart spot. We're still here as of 06/13/22.

06/26/22 ~ Oldest brother extracted me from prior spot and paid for 3 days
at a Super 8 in Bremerton. I paid for three more days on 06/27/22. Now, I'm
reattempting to find an affordable place to rent short-term.



:: Overview of things i Want to Do ::

Been aching to revive involvement with Life by resuming the pursuit of
achieving milestones pertaining to educational, personal and professional
goals.

Also, have many projects in mind. Some examples are detailed here: <
https://www.evernote.com/shard/s730/sh/28561dd8-eca0-43a4-b50c-0791e1be2e12=
/68847b121568be9ab7187b087af37ccd
>.



:: Conclusion ::


Again, top priorities are: organize my Evernote account; secure stable base
of operations; Acquire a Vehicle; build and launch employment program; pick
up part/ full time work as Nomadic Litter Patrol =F0=9F=A6=9D; and resume t=
he pursuit
of achieving milestones pertaining to educational, personal and
professional goals.

Am willing to negotiate rental contract with anyone who is able. Message
back if you've read this + have the authority to discuss and are willing.

Otherwise, forward me to the inbox(s) of the right person/ people if you're
Administration and want to help. =F0=9F=99=8F=F0=9F=8F=BB
