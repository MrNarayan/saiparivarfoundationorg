 Hello Administrator, 
 
 You got a new message from SaiParivarFoundation!

 Message: Hello,

Running a website like saiparivarfoundation.org is a lot like trying to fill a leaky bucket.

You promote, get website visitor, they drop out... you promote, get more website visitors, they drop out...

But today I wanted to address the "leaky bucket" effect that keeps website owners and online businesses running on a treadmill without reaching their income goals.

I've identified 5 ongoing challenges that can keep you from reaching your business goals with your online business offering.

Ongoing Challenge 1: Attracting Leads and Getting People to Opt-In

In order to sustain your website and sell your product, you need people who are interested enough to actually consider your offers.

Building an engaged list of subscribers is the key here... but did you know there's a way your website can help you with that?

Ongoing Challenge 2: Converting Leads into Happy Paying Customers

Once you've figured out a way to get more people to join your email list, you need to tell them about your paid product and offerings in a way that converts.

The standard email marketing funnel works... but if they don't buy, there are more organic ways to get them to purchase your paid offerings right inside your website.

Ongoing Challenge 3: Having a Leaky Checkout Experience & Losing Out On Sales

Once you've done all of the hard work of getting people to say yes to your paid offerings... you definitely don't want to lose out on sales by having a leaky checkout experience.

Statistics show that 77% of people who click the “Buy Now” button never complete their order, but there's a way to recoup these sales.

Ongoing Challenge 4: Increasing Return Customers and Recurring Revenue

Once you've got customers... your job is done, right? Not so fast!

You can offer more solutions, products, and ongoing access to these same customers over time... because the probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20% and the probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%.

Ongoing Challenge 5: Customers Who Fall Off The Wagon and do not buy

Customer retention is key to the long-term success of your website. But it's normal for customers to fall off the wagon, get busy, and stop logging into your website.

Or is it?

If you use smart nurturing strategies, you can keep your customers engaged and actively benefitting from your website to reduce drop offs and refunds.

How our software overcomes each of these ongoing challenges:

These are real challenges that never seem to go away...

I know because I've been there myself. I've put in thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours figuring out what works, what doesn't, and how to fill my own website over the past 10 years.
