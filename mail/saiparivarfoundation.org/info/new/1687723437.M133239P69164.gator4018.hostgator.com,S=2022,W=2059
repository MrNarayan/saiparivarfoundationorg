 Hello Administrator, 
 
 You got a new message from SaiParivarFoundation!

 Message: I am a high school junior and a member of the Hindu community in Seattle. I am working with the National Bone Marrow Registry to increase the number of South Asians in the registry. Currently, it is very difficult for a South Asian diagnosed with blood cancer to find a bone marrow match, since there are not many South Asians in the registry. Here is more information about the issue: https://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-blood-stem-cells/how-matching-works/ 

I am looking to host an informational booth at the temples in the area. I would set up a table with volunteers and posters to spread awareness, and allow people to register onsite. We would bring all of the supplies myself, so it would be no cost to the temple. 

I would like to host a booth on the busiest days at your temple, probably during one of your events. Would this be possible, and what are the steps to moving ahead on this?
