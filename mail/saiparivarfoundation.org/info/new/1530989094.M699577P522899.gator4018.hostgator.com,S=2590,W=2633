 Hello Administrator, 
 
 You got a new message from SaiParivarFoundation!

 Message: Namaste,

My name is Sravya Vishnubhatla and I am a Program Manager at Microsoft who has recently moved to the Seattle area. Previously, while living in Boston, I pursued a venture I call "Rakshak" to help women's hygiene issues back in India. 

I would love to begin this project here in the Seattle area as well. To provide a bit of background on the issue: An estimated 355 million Indian women and girls must find ways to cope with monthly menstrual hygiene. Only 12% of Indian women can afford commercially available napkins, causing numerous social and health problems. Rakshak aims to help women gain access to menstrual care products and begin the long and difficult process of educating them about women's health. By distributing individually sized menstrual packages to women's centers in India, women's health and quality of life will be improved. These packages hope to be made of reusable cloth pads, a product that lasts 3-5 years. By providing 6 pads per women, many women can have products to last them for quite some time.
 
To give a little insight to the costs of this endeavor:

One woman requires 3 daily pads and 3 nightly pads. One day pad is $4.05 and one night pad is $4.44. For one woman, then, the cost is approximately $25. 

I would love to see if the community wants to raise funds for this project. Alternatively, we can hold a drive and receive donations from community members on sanitary products outside of the reusable cloths. 

Please let me know if you'd like more information or if I should come in to talk to someone.

Thank you,
Sravya
