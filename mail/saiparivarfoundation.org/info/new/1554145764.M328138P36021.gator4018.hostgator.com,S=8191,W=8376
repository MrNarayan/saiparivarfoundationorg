Hello everyone,

We wanted to keep you up-to-date in regards to the work Sound Transit is do=
ing and its impacts to our electric system in your area. Sound Transit is c=
oming to a point in their work where they may need our electric lines to be=
 de-energized for their crews to safely perform their work. Also, some of y=
ou currently have temporary service lines and we will need to re-connect yo=
u permanently to the electric system once Sound Transit crews have complete=
d their work in your area.

What this means to you is that some customers may experience a planned powe=
r outage, or possibly two, over the next few months; just as before, we wil=
l work to give you as much advance notification as possible so proper arran=
gements can be made and also work around your business hours. We understand=
 being without power is inconvenient and we are coordinating with Sound Tra=
nsit to lessen these impacts as much as possible.

Thank you again for your patience, understanding and assistance as we work =
with Sound Transit to complete this work as quickly and safely as possible.=
 If there should be any questions regarding PSE's portion of this work, ple=
ase contact the PSE project manager, Josh Grenner, at 425-457-4542 or joshu=
a.grenner@pse.com.

Sincerely,
