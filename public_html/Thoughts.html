                <h3 class="center"> GURUJI's THOUGHT OF THE DAY</h3>
                <h4>19TH OCTOBER 2014: "Knowledge""</h4>                    
                <p>People know about how much they know - as they claim. But do they know how much they do not know? Knowledge of one's ignorance is a more creative knowledge than their knowledge of how much they know. Time and space are unlimited factors of our existences and therefore the knowledge. The Sadguru and the saints used to impart this knowledge of ignorance and therefore a search for knowledge to their disciples. Those who realised their ignorance sought for knowledge and after long and strenuous struggle became realised. No person can realise life unless he has realised his ignorance.</p>                    
                
                <h4>20TH OCTOBER 2014: "Be Simple"</h4>
                <p>In the material world what people show is what they try to sell and what they sell is what they try to show. In the spiritual realm it is different. The real elements that the Guru wants to bestow on the pupil are never demonstrated and the real pupil knows about it. Avoid being contaminated by such persons who try to show something because they are trying to sell some it (even the mental complex) in the name of Guru or God or philanthropy. Be with the simple and guileless believers.</p>

                <h4>25TH OCTOBER 2014: "True Devotee"</h4>
                <p>The difference between a true devotee and a fake devotee (trying to acquire social and other Powers by the use of the Guru's name) may be written in the following language -- the power of love for the Guru versus the love of power of the Guru. "THE POWER OF LOVE WINS OVER THE LOVE OF POWER”. Be aware of these lovers of power before they hijack your mind away from you.</p>

                <h4>28TH OCTOBER 2014: "TRUE HAPPINESS – MAKE OTHERS SMILE"</h4>
                <p>In happiness one should not be so absorbed that he does not notice the suffering of the less fortunate and the miserable fellow beings. The saints forget their own suffering by enjoying the happiness that they give to their devotees"</p>

                <h4>29TH OCTOBER 2014: "BE HUMBLE"</h4>
                <p>Oh Lord, don't raise my status so high in the world that my little home becomes a burden to me. Don't give me so much happiness that I become stoical to others' sorrow. Don't give me such power that I can use on the weak and the meek. Don't fill my heart with such emotion that I feel pained seeing the happiness and achievements of others."</p>

                <h4>30TH OCTOBER 2014: "A TRUE CHILD OF BABA"</h4>
                <p>The little lamps that have been kindled in us by the Lord are for lighting other lamps. None on this earth received enlightenment who had not been taught the lesson to distribute its energy among others. We should pray for being taught the lesson to enkindle others before we wish to be kindled. This path is easier."</p>

                <h4>31st OCTOBER 2014: "A TRUE CHILD OF BABA"</h4>
                <p>A saint is basically a lover and secondarily a Guru of the disciples. He plays the role of the Guru because by playing such a role he can best express his love and concerns. Simultaneously, he can protect them and guide them towards spiritual evolution. He does not follow the career of a Guru but the call of the heart of a lover.""</p>
