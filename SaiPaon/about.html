                    Shri Sai Baba is revered as one of the greatest saints ever seen in India, endowed with unprecedented powers, and is worshipped as a God incarnate. (SAI meaning Sakshaat Ishwar) - GOD THE ABSOLUTE
                    This mysterious Fakir first made HIS appearance in Shirdi as a youth and remained there throughout His long life. HE transformed the lives of those who met Him and continuously is doing so even after HIS Samadhi in 1918 for those whose hearts are touched by his love and who pray and call Him at any emergency in life for his blessings.
                    <br />
                    Baba stated that His mission is to "Give Blessings" without discrimination to all, and He proves it in myriad ways by healing the sick, saving lives, protecting the vulnerable, averting accidents, granting offspring, facilitating financial gain, bringing people into harmony within themselves and with each other and, above all, in effecting the spiritual evolution and transformation of those who came to him as the last resort.
                    <br />
                    Baba is, as one of His contemporary devotees put it, "The embodiment of the Supreme Spirit lighting the sadhakas (seekers') path by His every word and action".
                    To His devotees, Baba is nothing less than a GOD. This has been a matter of experience and not imaginary.
