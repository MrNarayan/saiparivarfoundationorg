      <h3 class="center"> Shri Sai Baba is revered as one of the greatest saints ever seen in India, endowed with unprecedented powers, and is worshipped as a God incarnate. (SAI meaning Sakshaat Ishwar) - GOD THE ABSOLUTE
          <br> This mysterious Fakir first made HIS appearance in Shirdi as a youth and remained there throughout His long life. 
        HE transformed the lives of those who met Him and continuously is doing so even after 
        HIS Samadhi in 1918 for those whose hearts are touched by his love and who pray and call Him at any emergency in life for his blessings.

            Lendi is significant as the place which Baba used to visit every day. It contains some tombs, a shrine, and most importantly, the perpetually burning lamp lit by Baba and placed between the two trees he planted.

        Between the neem tree and the bodhi tree is Nanda Deep ("lamp of bliss", also known as Akhanda Deep - "perpetually burning lamp"), the lamp that was originally lit by Baba.

        Gurusthan means "place of the guru". It is where Baba spent most of his time when he first came to Shirdi, and also where, according to Baba, the tomb of his own guru is located, by the neem tree.

Although it is not a major festival for everyone in India, it is of great importance in Shirdi, being the only festival which Baba asked devotees to celebrate. It falls on the full moon day of the month of Ashad in the Hindu calendar (June-July). <br>
